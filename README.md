# Who am I?
I'm a full-stack website developer. I started web development over two years ago and I still love it. I'd love to learn C# or C++ and get into game development, but that can be put off for later. I'm also still a high school student, so I want to get a job related to my liking.
# What languages do I know?
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- Python

I'm not a professional in Python, however, I have made web applications with it.
